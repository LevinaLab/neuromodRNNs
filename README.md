### Neuromod RNN
This repository contains a JAX implementation of neuromodRNN, which combines e-prop[1] update with diffusion of neurotransmitters (which carry learning signals). The current repostory is still under development and no tutorial 
notebooks are available.

The jax e-prop implementation of this repository is inspired in the implementation of original e-prop paper authors: https://github.com/IGITUGraz/eligibility_propagation
